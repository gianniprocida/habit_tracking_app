    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    csv files (pricing data ) are downloaded through web scraping, after which they are cleaned using 
    using pandas. Data are going to be distributed across several databases.
         For example, we create a database with only BTC pricing data, EOS pricing data, ETH pricing data, and LTC pricing data.
